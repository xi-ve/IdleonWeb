## Quick Start

### Option 1: Pre-compiled Binaries (Easiest) ⭐

**Download and run - no setup required!**

1. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/xi-ve/IdleonWeb/releases)
2. Download the appropriate file for your system:
   - 🐧 **Linux**: `IdleonWeb-linux-v{version}.tar.gz`
   - 🪟 **Windows**: `IdleonWeb-windows-v{version}.zip` 
   - 🍎 **macOS**: `IdleonWeb-macos-v{version}.tar.gz`
3. Extract the archive to a folder
4. **Install Node.js** (required): [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) - Get the LTS version
5. Run the executable:
   - **Linux/macOS**: `./IdleonWeb`
   - **Windows**: `IdleonWeb.exe`
6. Node.js dependencies will install automatically on first run
7. Open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser to configure plugins

**Requirements:**
- Node.js must be installed on your system
- No Python or manual setup required!

---

### Option 2: Manual Setup (From Source)

**For developers or if pre-compiled binaries are unavailable for your platform.**

#### Windows Setup (if dependencies are missing)
If you don't have Python or Node.js installed, download and install them first:

**Required Downloads:**
- **Python 3.8+**: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) - Get the latest stable version
- **Node.js 22+**: [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) - Get the LTS (Long Term Support) version

**Installation Steps:**
1. Install Python (make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation)
2. Install Node.js (use default settings)
3. Open Command Prompt (cmd.exe) or PowerShell as Administrator
4. Verify installations by running:
   ```cmd
   python --version
   node --version
   ```
5. If commands are not recognized, restart your terminal and try again
6. Follow the Universal Setup steps below

#### Universal Setup (Recommended for source installations)
1. Download and extract the IdleonWeb source files to a folder
2. Open your terminal:
   - **Windows**: Open Command Prompt (cmd.exe) or PowerShell
   - **Linux**: Open Terminal
3. Navigate to the IdleonWeb folder:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/IdleonWeb
   ```
4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python setup.py
   ```
5. Start the launcher:
   ```bash
   python launch.py
   ```
6. The application will automatically discover available plugins and ask if you want to enable them
7. Auto-injection will run automatically (enabled by default) - the game will launch with enhancements
8. Open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser to configure plugins

---

## How to Use

### Starting the Launcher
```bash
python launch.py
```

### Launching the Game
**Automatic Mode (Default):**
- The game will launch automatically after plugin discovery
- Auto-injection runs immediately when the launcher starts
- To disable: use the `auto_inject off` command

**Manual Mode:**
1. Disable auto-injection: `auto_inject off`
2. In the launcher, type `inject` and press Enter
3. The game will open in a browser window

### Configuration
1. Open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser
2. Configure your plugins using the web interface
3. Changes take effect immediately

> **Note:** On first launch, if the game requires you to log in, the injection process may fail. Simply close the browser, then run the `inject` command again in the launcher after logging in. This is normal for the first run.

### Web Interface
- **Plugin Configuration** - Toggle features on/off, adjust settings
- **Real-Time Updates** - See changes immediately
- **Search & Filter** - Find items and manage game data
- **Mobile Friendly** - Works on phones and tablets

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Pre-compiled Binary Issues:**
- **"Node.js not found"**: Install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) and restart the executable
- **"Permission denied" (Linux/macOS)**: Run `chmod +x IdleonWeb` to make the file executable
- **Dependencies installing slowly**: This is normal on first run, subsequent starts will be faster
- **Binary won't start**: Try downloading the source code and using manual setup instead

**General Issues:**
- **Game doesn't launch?**
  - Make sure you have Chrome or Chromium installed
  - Try running `inject` again after a few seconds

- **Web interface not loading?**
  - Check that the launcher shows "Plugin UI web server started"
  - Try refreshing the browser page

- **Plugins not working?**
  - Ensure you typed `inject` in the launcher
  - Check the browser console for error messages

**Setup fails?**
- Make sure Python 3.8+ and Node.js are installed (for manual setup)
- Try running `python setup.py` - it can automatically install missing dependencies using package managers
- Run as administrator if needed (Windows)
- Consider using pre-compiled binaries instead

### Getting Help

- Check the browser console for error messages
- Look for red error messages in the launcher
- Ensure all dependencies are properly installed

## Credits

This project was inspired by and builds upon the excellent work of the original [Idleon-Injector](https://github.com/MrJoiny/Idleon-Injector) project by [@MrJoiny](https://github.com/MrJoiny). The original injector demonstrated the core concepts of browser automation and script injection for Legends of Idleon, which served as the foundation for this Python-based plugin system.

Key inspirations from the original project:
- Browser automation using Chrome DevTools Protocol
- Script interception and injection techniques
- Game context detection and integration
- Cross-platform compatibility approaches

This project extends those concepts with:
- Modern Python-based plugin architecture
- Web UI for plugin configuration
- Enhanced CLI with autocompletion
- Centralized configuration management
- Real-time plugin development workflow
- Categorized plugin organization
- Folderized plugin structure
